ABOUT

vanityhash is a tool that can discover data to be added to the end of a 
file to produce a desired hex hash fragment.  It searches a message 
space and runs a hashing algorithm against the original data plus the 
appended data to determine if the desired hash fragment is present.  
vanityhash can run multiple parallel workers to effectively make use of 
multiple processors/cores/threads, and supports multiple hash digest 
types (MD5, SHA1, SHA256, etc).

INSTALLATION

vanityhash requires Perl 5.6.0 or newer.  vanityhash requires several 
Perl modules, all of which are in a standard Perl installation (though 
your distribution may split Perl into "base" and "standard" packages).  
For SHA hashes and certain MD hashes, additional Perl modules may be 
required.

To "build" and install vanityhash:

  make
  make test
  make install
  make clean

/usr/local is the default Makefile prefix, use PREFIX to override.

USAGE

Please see the man page for full details.

  vanityhash [options] hexfragment < inputfile

  vanityhash --append [options] hexfragment < inputfile > outputfile
